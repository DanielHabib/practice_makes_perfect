## Things to pay attention when dealing with Strings
* ASCII or Unicode?
* Case Sensitive?
* White Space Significant?

## General Takes Aways
* Write out notes about the problem quickly
* State BCR first
* State Brute Force
* Try to conceptually as close to BCR before coding at all
* Outline the process of solving the problem into easily digestable steps
* After writing algorithm, consider the extreme Cases
* Test a data set if possible

## Mistakes
* Strings cannot have index assignment in python
* Incorrectly Wrote conditionals when Sorting
* Misinterpreted `Permutation` as meaning a re-order with variable length aka it could be shorter. This is not the case, permutation is a re-order with the same elements, no more no less.
* `hash` is a reserved keyword in python
