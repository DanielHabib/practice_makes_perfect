Pyhton implementations.

The Reference implementation in python is C Python
A reference implementation is the main implementation that others are based off of.
Different python implementations are used to improve performance and help interface with differnet programming languages.

For exampe in pypy, at the cost of being incapadable with certain libraries, you gain a 5 x performance increase.

Jython is used if you need to import java modules to your code.
Iron Python and PythonNet are used to interface with .NET libraries
