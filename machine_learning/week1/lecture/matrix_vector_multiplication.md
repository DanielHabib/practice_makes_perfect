# Matrix Vector Multiplication
AXB
columns in A must match rows in B to perform matrix multiplcation
To get yij, multiply As ith row with elements of matrix Bj abd add them up

We can solve our hypothesis for multpiple inputs using Matrix multiplication. All we have to do is add the value of each polynomial in the matrix A in AxB and multiply it 

We can calculate large quantities of input in a single matrix multiplication by setting up matrix A and B correctly
Can solve all of the input in one line of code.
prediction = DataMatrix * parameters
we just need the appropiate library for matrix multiplication
# IMPORTANT Leveraging Matrix Multiplication to process large quantities of input
When you have a large number of houses, implementing funciton execution in one single matrix multiplication vs using a forloop to input each variable is way more computational efficient.
