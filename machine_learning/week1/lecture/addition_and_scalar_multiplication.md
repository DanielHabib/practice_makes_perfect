# Addition
You can only add two matrices of the same dimension
You add the numbers in each position Aij + Bij = Cij

# Scalar Multiplication
When multiplying a matrix by a number, just multiply every element by that number, same with division since division is inverted multiplication
The order of scalar multiplication doesnt matter A * 3 = 3 * A

# Combination of Operands
We can combine these operations to make some pretty intense equations.
