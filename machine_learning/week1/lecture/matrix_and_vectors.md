# Matrixs
Dimension of Matrix: {rows} x {columns}
R^3x2 Double R=RealNmnber

In this class: Matrix elements Asubij matrixes are 1 indexed in this class

We can quickly reference these properties

A vector is a matrix with only 1 column.

[1,2,3,4] = 4 dimemsional vector, or an element with 4 elements => R^4
ysubi is the ith element in the vector 
zero index vs 1 index just says where we start, in this calss we will assume 1 indexed vectors
