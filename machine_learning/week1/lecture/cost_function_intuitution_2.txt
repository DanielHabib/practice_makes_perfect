When the cost function takes Theta0 and Theta1 we get a Three Dimensional Graph.  We will use countour plots to represent the proper value

What I dot get is how to generate a countour function

How to automatically and efficiently calculate the best values of theta 0 and theta 1 that minimizes the cost function j
